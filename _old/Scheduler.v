    Interference is how a local action affects the global state.
    It is the sharing is shared state concurrency. This will be specific to
    each type of effect and semantics.

    - Also this is probaly not a decidable function, but a relation.
      For example, consider output queues
        [0: [send 2 m], 1: [send 2 n], 2: []]
      What should the new state [σ'] of process 2 be?
         [m, n] or [n, m]

    - Another consideration is [fairness] of [interference]. We claim
    the scheduler is fair, but if [interference]
    drops the messages of the same process infinitely often,
    that violates the fairness property.
